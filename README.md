- Moving left and right:
    - Use your position (the red point in the tracker). You can change the location required for the character to move using the left/right line spinboxes.
    - or use you arm angles. You move to the direction of the raised arm. You can change the angle treshold. (You have to be facing the camera)
- Jumping:
    - Squat so that the center (red point) is under the line for the spacebar to be pressed. You can change the line position.
    - Turn to the direction you want to jump to. The rotation treshold can be changed using the body rotation spinbox.
    - Standup so that the center is above the line for the spacebar to be released.
- You can flip and rotate the image and show the lines used for the tracking. 
- Reduced the quality using the spinbox if you encounter lag.
- When all your settings are ready, open jumpking, click start tracker inorder to start using the program.
- (dont forget to click on the game)
